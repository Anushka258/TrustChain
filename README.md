![TRUST CHAIN Logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/TRUST%20CHAIN-Reputation%20Platform-blue?style=for-the-badge)

## Project Description

TRUST CHAIN is a decentralized reputation scoring platform built on blockchain technology, specifically designed for freelance professionals. The platform leverages smart contracts to create a transparent, immutable, and trustworthy system for managing freelancer reputations, client reviews, and project completion records.

The platform addresses the critical challenge of trust in the freelance economy by providing a decentralized solution where reputation scores are calculated algorithmically based on verified client reviews, project completion rates, and account longevity. This eliminates the possibility of fake reviews and provides clients with reliable data to make informed hiring decisions.
